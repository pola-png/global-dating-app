# Connecting to a New GitHub Repository

Your GitHub account has been flagged, which is preventing deployment. The best solution is to use a new, clean repository.

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

Go to GitHub and create a new, **empty** repository. Do not add a README, .gitignore, or license file.

### Step 2: Update Your Project's Remote URL

Copy the command below. Replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your token and `YOUR_NEW_REPO_URL` with the URL of the new repository you just created.

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME.git && git push --force origin main
```

**Example:**
`git remote set-url origin https://ezekielxap-png:ghp_xxxxxxxx@github.com/ezekielxap-png/my-new-dating-app.git && git push --force origin main`

### Step 3: (If Step 2 fails) A More Forceful Reset

If the command above gives an error, it's safest to remove the old remote completely and add the new one.

**Command 1: Remove the old remote**
```bash
git remote remove origin
```

**Command 2: Add the new remote and push** (Replace with your token and new URL)
```bash
git remote add origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME.git && git push --force origin main
```

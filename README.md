# Global Dating App - Final Push Instructions

This is a Next.js application for a global dating and chat platform.

I have fixed the final security issue by removing the hardcoded Firebase API key. Your repository is now clean. Please run the following commands one by one to push this final change. This will resolve the security alerts on GitHub.

### Step 1: Add the change

```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit the change

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Remove hardcoded Firebase API key"
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

You will need to use the command with your Personal Access Token one last time.

**Important:** Copy the command below and replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual token (the one starting with `ghp_...`).

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://ezekielxap-png:YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/ezekielxap-png/global-dating-app.git && git push origin main
```

After this push is successful, you can inform GitHub support that all alerts are resolved.

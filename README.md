# Deploy to GitHub

Your code is ready to be deployed. To push the latest changes to your GitHub repository so AWS Amplify can build and deploy them, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement infinite scroll for the main feed"
git push origin main
```

After pushing, you can monitor the deployment progress in your AWS Amplify console.

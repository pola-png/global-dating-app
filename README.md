# DEPLOYMENT FIX: RUN THESE FINAL COMMANDS

You are seeing this error because your local Git history contains commits with secret keys, and GitHub is protecting you by blocking the push. The following commands will completely reset your local repository to a single, clean commit and then push it to GitHub.

**This is the final solution. Please run these commands one by one in your terminal.**

### Step 1: Remove the old, broken Git history
```bash
rm -rf .git
```

### Step 2: Create a new, clean repository
```bash
git init -b main
```

### Step 3: Add all your current (and now clean) files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 4: Create a single, clean commit
```bash
git commit -m "Final clean commit"
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub (You will need your Personal Access Token)
Copy the following command, paste it into your terminal, **replace the placeholder with your actual GitHub token**, and press Enter.

```bash
git remote add origin https://ezekielxap-png:YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/ezekielxap-png/global-dating-app.git && git push --force origin main
```
